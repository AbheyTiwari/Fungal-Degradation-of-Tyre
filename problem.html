                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#6A4A3C] mb-4 text-center">The Tire's Enduring Challenge: Degradation & Recycling</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Tires are engineered for extreme durability, a quality that becomes a significant environmental challenge at their end-of-life. Their complex chemical makeup makes them highly resistant to natural degradation, leading to millions of tires accumulating in landfills globally.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#EB6841] mb-3">Problem Statement: Persistent Complexity</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">A single tire is a sophisticated matrix of diverse, highly resilient materials, including:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        <li>Natural & synthetic rubber</li>
                        <li>Steel wires</li>
                        <li>Zinc oxide</li>
                        <li>Vulcanized sulfur crosslinks</li>
                        <li>Nylon and polyester textiles</li>
                        <li>Carbon black</li>
                        <li>Antioxidants and plasticizers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">This inherent complexity renders tires exceptionally resistant to natural degradation. Even specialized fungi capable of breaking down natural rubber components struggle with the synthetic materials, robust sulfur bonds, and embedded metals. Traditional research often focuses on degrading only the rubber elements, leaving behind substantial toxic and structural residues untouched, preventing true end-of-life solutions.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#EDC951] mb-3">🧮 The Final Innovation: A Self-Regulating Biosphere</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">To ensure the stability and efficacy of this complex system, mathematical models will be fundamental:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">

This is achieved by programming a natural depletion of critical nutrients (like nitrogen) or key substrates, leading to the controlled cessation of microbial activity.</li>
